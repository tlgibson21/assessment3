## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Read in Data File

1. Read in the file, making the gene identifiers the row names. Show a table of values for the first six genes.

```{r gene_expression}
URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/SLE712_files/master/assessment_task3/bioinfo_asst3_part1_files/gene_expression.tsv"

pip <- read.table(URL,header = TRUE,row.names = 1)
pip
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
