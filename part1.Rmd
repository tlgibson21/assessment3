## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r library, echo=FALSE}
library("seqinr")
library("kableExtra")
library("R.utils")
```

## Section 1: Gene expression

This is my introduction to analysing gene expression.

1. Read in the file, making the gene identifiers the row names. Show a table of values for the first six genes.

```{r gene_exp}
# Read in data file

URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/SLE712_files/master/assessment_task3/bioinfo_asst3_part1_files/gene_expression.tsv"

gene_exp <- read.table(URL, header=TRUE, row.names=1)

dt1 <- head(gene_exp)

dt1 %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

2. Make a new column which is the mean of the other columns. Show a table of values for the first six genes.

```{r mean}
# Create a new column

gene_exp$Mean <- apply(gene_exp, 1, mean)

dt2 <- head(gene_exp)

dt2 %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

3. List the 10 genes with the highest mean expression

```{r ten}
# List 10

sorted <- gene_exp[order(-gene_exp$Mean),]

list <- head(sorted, 10)

dt3 <- rownames(list)

dt3 %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

4. Determine the number of genes with a mean < 10

```{r below}
# Mean less than 10

lessthan <- subset(gene_exp,Mean < 10)

nrow(lessthan)
```

5. Make a histogram plot of the mean values and include it into your report

```{r hist}
# Plot a histogram

hist(gene_exp$Mean, xlab="Mean",
     main="Histogram of Mean Values")
```

## Section 2: Growth data

This is my introduction to analysing growth data.

```{r mychunk}
# Read in data file

URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/SLE712_files/master/assessment_task3/bioinfo_asst3_part1_files/growth_data.csv"
growth <- read.table(URL,sep=",")
growth
str(growth)
growth <- read.table(URL,sep=",",header=TRUE)
growth
str(growth)
growth <- read.csv(URL)
growth
head(growth)
```
